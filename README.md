# Project IMT Atlantique & Clever Cloud

OpenHalo is a tool that aims to simplify the migration from MySQL to PostgreSQL. It automates schema conversion, data migration, and performance validation. Our team contributed by developing a Rust-based testing framework, running database benchmarks, and writing migration scripts and technical documentation.
*Leading by Nélia Fedele, Sei Bayle, François-Xavier Collot, Juliette Faurie, Hugo Bentata, Montabhar Ettaieb and Houda Daouairi (students from IMT Atlantique)*
